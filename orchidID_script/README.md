A script used to automatically pull orcid IDs when given a list of names.

Steps to run:
1. Dowload jar file
2. Use console/terminal to navigate to directory where jar file is downloaded
3. Type "java -jar orcidID_script.jar [file path to input csv of first and last names] [output file path of your choice]"

An example of an input csv file can also be found in this repo ("person_example.csv"), but the general input file format is:

col1   | col2 <br />
fname1 | fname1 <br />
fname2 | lname2 <br />
etc.
