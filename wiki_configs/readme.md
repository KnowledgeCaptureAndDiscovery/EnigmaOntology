## About configuration files.

Configuration files allow to create custom subset of ontologies using one or more enigma ontologies.
Each configuration file must be placed on this folder and is a `CSV` file where the each line represents an Enigma Ontology.
For each ontology the first row is the name of the ontology and the second row is the directory where is found.
